## Tutorials

- Found one by Leviton on Home Depot that was good

## Materials Needed

- Electrical Outlet

## Steps

1. Turn power off
2. Most outlets actually have a strip gauge on the back and wires should be stripped to that length
3. Make shepherds hook with all wires. When hooked to screw clockwise so that it tightens with the screw. May be able to use quick connect if outlet has it.
4. Pair positive wires from the same cable. Positive (black) goes to brass and negative (white) goes to silver of the same outlet (top or bottom).
